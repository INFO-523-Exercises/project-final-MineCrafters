## Dataset


In an era where fashion and comfort go hand in hand, the **SoleMate** shoe recommendation system aims to revolutionize the way people choose their footwear. Footwear selection is a highly subjective and personal decision, influenced by various factors like preferred brand, price and discount, lifestyle, and fashion preferences. To address this, our project aims to develop a state-of-the-art machine learning-based recommendation system to assist individuals in finding the perfect pair of shoes that suits their unique needs.

To deliver a better seamless and highly personalized shopping experience for shoe enthusiasts, we came up with idea of **SoleMate**. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, our system will take into account a wide array of factors to generate tailored shoe recommendations for users.

```

The dataset comes from the [Kaggle Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/adidas-vs-nike). The dataset consists of 3268 products from Nike and Adidas with various features of information including their `ratings`, `discount`, `sales price`, `listed price`, `product description`, and the `number of reviews`. With this sizeable and diverse sample of shoes from these two most popular brands, this dataset promises to serve as a foundational resource for building the **SoleMate** system. The table representing the features and their description is presented below.

| Feature       | Description                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Product Name  | Name of the product                                 |
| Product ID    | Unique product ID                                   |
| Listing Price | Price of the product as listed                      |
| Sales Price   | Price after applying discount rate                  |
| Discount      | Discount percent provided on the product            |
| Brand         | Brand of the product                                |
| Description   | Description of the product                          |
| Rating        | Rating provided for the product by users (out of 5) |
| Reviews       | Number of reviews provided on the product           |
| Last visited  | Last visit on the product by a customer             |

## Question

How do you find the perfect Solemate?

## Analysis plan

By following the below analysis plan, the project can efficiently implement a robust recommendation system that enhances the footwear shopping experience for users.

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    -   Acquire and load the dataset for both shoe brands.
    -   Explore the dataset to understand its structure and the variables it contains.
    -   Visualize data distributions, identify outliers, and check for missing values.
    -   Analyze customer reviews and ratings to gain insights into user preferences.

-   Data Preprocessing:

    -   Clean the data by addressing missing values and outliers.
    -   Transform categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for brand, material, and style).
    -   Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

-   Data Visualization

    -   Visualizing the favourite shoe brand based on the customer rating and the number of reviews.

-   Feature Engineering:

    -   Create additional features if necessary, such as sentiment analysis scores for customer reviews.

-   Training and Testing:

    -   Select machine learning algorithms suitable for recommendation tasks, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.
    -   Train multiple recommendation models on the training data.
    -   Evaluate model performance using testing data.

-   Model Evaluation:

    -   Utilize metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and accuracy to assess each model's performance.
    -   Compare the results to determine which models are the most effective in making recommendations.

-   Choosing the Best Model:

    -   Select the model with the lowest error or highest accuracy, depending on the chosen evaluation metric.
