Footwear selection is a highly subjective and personal decision, influenced by various factors like preferred brand, price and discount, lifestyle, and fashion preferences. To address this, our project aims to develop a state-of-the-art machine learning-based recommendation system to assist individuals in finding the perfect pair of shoes that suits their unique needs.\n\nTo deliver a better seamless and highly personalized shopping experience for shoe enthusiasts, we came up with idea of **SoleMate**. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, our system will take into account a wide array of factors to generate tailored shoe recommendations for users.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#> Installing necessary libraries \n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#> Loading the Dataset - solemate\n\nsolemate <- read.csv(\"data/solemate.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset comes from the [Kaggle Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/adidas-vs-nike). The dataset consists of 3268 products from Nike and Adidas with various features of information including their `ratings`, `discount`, `sales price`, `listed price`, `product description`, and the `number of reviews`. With this sizeable and diverse sample of shoes from these two most popular brands, this dataset promises to serve as a foundational resource for building the **SoleMate** system. The table representing the features and their description is presented below.\n\n| Feature       | Description                                         |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Product Name  | Name of the product                                 |\n| Product ID    | Unique product ID                                   |\n| Listing Price | Price of the product as listed                      |\n| Sales Price   | Price after applying discount rate                  |\n| Discount      | Discount percent provided on the product            |\n| Brand         | Brand of the product                                |\n| Description   | Description of the product                          |\n| Rating        | Rating provided for the product by users (out of 5) |\n| Reviews       | Number of reviews provided on the product           |\n| Last visited  | Last visit on the product by a customer             |\n\n## Question\n\nHow do you find the perfect Solemate?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\nBy following the below analysis plan, the project can efficiently implement a robust recommendation system that enhances the footwear shopping experience for users.\n\n-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\n    -   Acquire and load the dataset for both shoe brands.\n    -   Explore the dataset to understand its structure and the variables it contains.\n    -   Visualize data distributions, identify outliers, and check for missing values.\n    -   Analyze customer reviews and ratings to gain insights into user preferences.\n\n-   Data Preprocessing:\n\n    -   Clean the data by addressing missing values and outliers.\n    -   Transform categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for brand, material, and style).\n    -   Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.\n\n-   Data Visualization\n\n    -   Visualizing the favourite shoe brand based on the customer rating and the number of reviews.\n\n-   Feature Engineering:\n\n    -   Create additional features if necessary, such as sentiment analysis scores for customer reviews.\n\n-   Training and Testing:\n\n    -   Select machine learning algorithms suitable for recommendation tasks, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.\n    -   Train multiple recommendation models on the training data.\n    -   Evaluate model performance using testing data.\n\n-   Model Evaluation:\n\n    -   Utilize metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and accuracy to assess each model's performance.\n    -   Compare the results to determine which models are the most effective in making recommendations.\n\n-   Choosing the Best Model:\n\n    -   Select the model with the lowest error or highest accuracy, depending on the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
