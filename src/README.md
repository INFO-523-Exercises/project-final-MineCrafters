# MineCrafters_main

## Overview
"MineCrafters_main" is a comprehensive Jupyter notebook dedicated to the analysis of housing data in the USA. This project involves data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, to derive insights from the USA Housing dataset and regression modelling to predict the prices of different properties based on various features in the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Import and Setup:** Utilizes Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Data Loading:** Reads data from a CSV file, specifically focused on housing data in the USA.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides an initial analysis to understand data structure, types, and summary statistics.
- **Data Cleaning:** Processes data for analysis, including rounding off income values and handling missing data.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes various plots to visualize relationships within the data, such as price distributions, price vs. income, price vs. house age, and more.
- **Modelling:** Trying out various ML Algorithms like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor and Elastic Net Regression (For Regularization).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (optional for advanced visualizations)

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the analysis or add new features are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-and-pull request workflow.
